Great that you want to enter an issue. 

I hope I can help, but to do so, please keep in mind the following:

- Are you sure that your code is valid? This a open source project not your corporate support :)
- Do you use the latest version of the addon?
- Is there a demo which relates to your problem? Does it work there?
